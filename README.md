# Fish_Morphology
Final Project for Biology 708

Fitting a linear model to morphological data

My dataset consists of a response (Length), and 9 predictor variables that are all morphological measurements of Lake Whitefish hatchlings. This is only 1 year of the dataset, so if my project is chosen I will acquire several more years of data. All the predictor variables are correlated, as they all come from the same individual. As the fish grows, so do all the other body features that we measure (except the yolk, which diminishes). A simple linear model won't account for the fact that these variables are co-related, so I want to be able to fit a model that accounts for the correlations. 

I want to determine the relative importance of each predictor, hierarchy of influence on length. Which variable is the best indicator of total length? I also want to be able to accurately predict total length based on a few morphological measurements, to make data collection easier.

Questions:
Does age or treatment have a larger influence on length?
Which is the best predictor variable? Is it the same predictor every year?
Do treatment groups significantly vary in size between years? 
Does the average size across all treatment groups change year to year?
Is the growth rate consistent between treatment groups? Between years?
